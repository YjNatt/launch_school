The same reason as the last exercise. Except this time the local variable in myValue has the same
name as the outer scope variable on line 1. When we reassign variable 'a' within myValue the 
reassignment occurs on the local variable and has no effect on the global variable 'a'.
This is known as variable shadowing.
