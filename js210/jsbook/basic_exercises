Exercise 1:
  > 'John' + ' Doe'
  = 'John Doe'

Exercise 2:
  > let number = 4936
  > let ones = number % 10
  > ones
  = 6

  > number = (number - ones) / 10
  = 493

  > let tens = number % 10
  > tens
  = 3

  > number = (number - tens) / 10
  = 49

  > let hundreds = number % 10
  > hundreds
  = 9

  > let thousands = (number - hundreds) / 10
  > thousands
  = 4

Exercise 3:
  String
  Boolean
  Number
  Number
  Undefined
  Object

Exercise 4:
  Statement
  Expression
  Expression

Exercise 5:
  Code logs '510' because of implicit coercion.
  JavaScript first coerces the number 10 into a string then concatenates
  with the string '5'

Exercise 6:
  > console.log(Number('5') + 10);

Exercise 7:
  > console.log(`the value of 5 + 5 is ${ Number('5') + 10 }.`);
  the value of 5 + 5 is 15.

Exercise 8:
  No, JavaScript returns undefined

Exercise 9:
  > let names = ['asta', 'butterscotch', 'pudding', 'neptune', 'darwin'];

Exercise 10:
  > let pets = { asta: 'dog', butterscotch: 'cat', pudding: 'cat',
                 neptune: 'fish', darwin: 'lizard'}

Exercise 11:
  false because string comparission is case sensitive

Exercise 12:
  3 because parseInt stops converting strings once it encounters a non-digit.
  Which in this case is `.`

Exercise 13:
  true because when comparing two strings, JavaScript performs a character-by-character comparison going from left to right
  so '1' < '9' so that means '12' is less than '9'
