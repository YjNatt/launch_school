Question 1:
  No because on line 3 we initialize a local variable with the same name as the global variable.
  This is known as variable shadowing and therefore the global variable on line 1 and the local variable
  on line 3 are different.

Question 5:
  Nothing because we broke out of the function on line 3 with the return statement

Question 6:
  Nothing is logged to the console but the return value is 'Yipeee!!!!'
