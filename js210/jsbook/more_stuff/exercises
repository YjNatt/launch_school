Question 1:
  logs [ 1, 4, 3];
  On line 3 we are mutating the array by reassigning the 2nd element of the 
  array to the value of 4.
  It also shows that array2 is pointing to the same array as array1

Question 2:
  Error occured on line 4 in the exercise2 file.
  We get a ReferenceError exception stating that the name greeting isn't defined.
  On line 7 it states that the detected error occured at column 15 of line 4 within the hello function.

Question 3:
  Math.sqrt(37);

Question 5:
  converts a string into an array of words,
  reverses the words,
  transform the words into the length of the words.

Question 7:
  Exception Handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner by using a try/
  catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises.

  It allows programmers to deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure
  or nasty bug.

Question 10:
  ++ when applied to a string coerces it into a number and the it increments.
  Keep in mind since ++ is post-increment the return value is the original number then it is incremented.
