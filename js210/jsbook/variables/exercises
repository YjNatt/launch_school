Question 3:
  ReferenceError: foo is not defined
  foo was declared inside the block with a block scope therefore you cannot access it from outside the block
  
Question 4:
  Constants are not able to be reassigned which is why we get a TypeError on line 6
  and the output on lines 2,3,4,7,8,9 all use 'Victor' as the constant NAME

Question 5:
  program logs bar

  On line 1 we declare variable foo with the value 'bar'
  On line 2 we start a block which creates a new scope for variables.
  On line 3 we declare a new variable named foo with the value 'qux', however
  the variable declared in the block variable shadows the variable that was created outside the block.
  As well as only being accessible from within the block.
  On line 4 we exit out of the block
  On Line 6 we log the value variable foo is referencing which is the same variable that was declared on line 1
  which is why we log 'bar'

Question 6:
  No because consts have the same variable scope rules as variable declared with let
  line 3 did not produce an error because the const was declared within a block which has a different variable scope
